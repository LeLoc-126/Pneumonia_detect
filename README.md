# Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-ray Images

This repository contains a deep learning-based approach to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. We utilize a pre-trained model and the [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle to perform this task.

## Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening, especially for infants and elderly individuals. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. In this project, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images into two categories:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**

## Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and contains a collection of 5,863 X-ray images categorized into:
- Normal (1,583 images)
- Pneumonia (4,273 images)

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets:
- **Training Set**: 5,216 images
- **Validation Set**: 16 images
- **Test Set**: 624 images

## Pre-trained Model

We leverage a **pre-trained CNN model** such as **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, or **InceptionV3**, fine-tuning it on our dataset to improve performance and reduce the computational cost. Pretrained models offer significant advantages by leveraging transfer learning, allowing us to build a more efficient model with fewer data.
